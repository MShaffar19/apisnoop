# Tracking where we are, have a vision for where we are going<a id="sec-1"></a>

The goal is to get a clear vision on closing open Endpoints most efficiently.

## Why a [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gdtP8phFQ70xNkRSmKifbB_0tyPQB-QB2K0DWdJJnS4/edit#gid=0)?<a id="sec-1-1"></a>

-   One source of truth it is a summery that will not replace REAL tools
-   Retaining Conformance Office hours meeting feedback about specific endpoints
-   Show knowledge continuity in customer interaction
-   No unified overview between APISnoop, Conformance Dashboard and Mock template query
-   Improve co-ordination in the team
-   Clear overview what is the status of all individual open endpoints

## What Gains will be made?<a id="sec-1-2"></a>

-   Life cycle families can be identified with ease
-   Conformance feedback get recorded ie. Endpoints on low priority

## The way forward<a id="sec-1-3"></a>

-   The Sheet is a summery that will not replace REAL tools
-   Tools should rather be improved to replace the need for a Sheet.
