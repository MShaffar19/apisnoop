#+TITLE: APISnoop 1.20 OKRs
#+AUTHOR: ii.coop

* v1.20 
Our goal is to not make radical changes to process or approach, but iterate on our working methods to increase velocity and output in a stable, consistent way.
** Update for 1.20
** **Increase Stable Test Coverage**
*** **KR1 increase new conformant stable endpoints**
- Goal: 30   - Stretch Goal: 40
- Current Status:
  - Test write:
    [[  https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95128][Limit Apiserver Proxy Redirects]] needs to be resolved before a number of e2e tests can be completed.
    - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/92950][PodPorxy redirect test +7 Endpoint coverage]]
    - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/92950][NodeProxy Redirect Test - +7 endpoint coverage]]
      The test also points out configuration readiness issues for IPV6
      Both test currently on lower priority(hold), with a third test for ServiceProxy that can follow.
      This endpoint would likely not merge in 1.20
    Endpoint for 1.20
    - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95503][PodProxyWithPath & ServiceProxyWithPath test +12 Endpoint coverage]]
    - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/95524][Write NodeProxyWithPath Issue - + 4 endpoint coverage]]
    - 3 PR's for 17 Endpoints with intermittend flakes being reviewed
*** Discovering "missing" Conformance tests
     [[https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/19502][Override audit policy for conformance informing jobs #19502]]
     [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95388][Enable Logging of event requests to audit log in cluster/gce/gci/configure-helper.sh #95388]]
     Both PR's merged as well as [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95626][PR#95626]] to correct correct allocation of Conformance dating of endpoints affected
*** Conclusion
   - As expected getting endpoints to conformance is getting more difficult as seen with the Proxy endpoints
   - Underlying issue require additional community interaction to resolve
   - This does however contribute to a improved overall stability
*** **KR2 clean-up technical debt**
- Goal: Clean technical debt back to 1.15
  [[https://apisnoop.cncf.io/conformance-progress?relchart=number][Technical Debt]] has been cleared with the last inligible endpoints identified in 1.15
- Stretch Goal: 6 of 18 Endpoints of 1.14
- [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94969][Add test for listing Leases from all namespace #94969]] remove one old endpoint
- Only 5 endpoints remain for 1.14
- [[ https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/94954][Engaged]] with #SIG-Scheduling to pick up their technical
- They are making progress:[[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/94954][Untested Priority Class Life Cycle Test #94954]]
- The test PR is merge and soaking
- This would clean techical debt back to 1.11

** **Release Blocking k/k Jobs touching test/e2e or API**
Moved to Release Blocking Job instead of PR blocking Job by community agreement.
*** **Progress**
- The job within [[https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/19173][k/test-infra#19173]] is runnig on [[https://prow.cncf.io/][prow.cncf.io]]
- Caught new untested endpoint
- SIG Network responed with [[https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/19160][k/test-infra/#19160]]
  - to take responsibility for the Conformance of their API's
  - APISnoop also seem to gain more traction in the community in this way
*** **Status update**
- The job is running on Prow.k8s.io [[https://prow.k8s.io/?job=apisnoop-conformance-gate][apisnoop-conformance-gate]]
- The job is currently failing with: "root" execution of the PostgreSQL server is not permitted.
- It was fixed with [[https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/19432][PR#19432]] and merged, however we still experience problems in production
- We are currently engaging with SIG-Testing to replicate the production enviroment and understand it better
