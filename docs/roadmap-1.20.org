#+TITLE: APISnoop 1.20 OKRs
#+AUTHOR: ii.coop

* v1.20 
Our goal is to not make radical changes to process or approach, but iterate on our working methods to increase velocity and output in a stable, consistent way.
** **Final update for 1.20**
** **Increase Stable Test Coverage**
*** **KR1 increase new conformant stable endpoints**
- Goal: 30   - Stretch Goal: 40
- Status +26 (Merged):
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95713][+7 ReplicationController]]
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96485][+3 Pod+PodStatus Lifecycle]]
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96487][+5 AppV1Deployment Lifecycle]]
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95884][+5 PriorityClass endpoints]]
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/92813][+1 delete/CollectionNamespacedEvent]]
  - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89753][+5 Event resource lifecycle]]
*** **Other Conformance news**
  - 8 New Endpoints was promoted to GA with conformance tests
  - 13 NodeProxy endpoints was marked as Ineligible for conformance after community engagement

*** **Greater effort after 60%**
- To reach the traget took lot of deflaking, policy changed, bugs fixed, new images built and community intercation
- In the latter part of the remaining endpoints for conformance it is taking a lot more effort
- We have more tests currenly blocked due to bugs or changes requiered
*** **Conclusion**
- No new techical debt was allowed in 1.20
- 34 additional Endpoints have conformance tests since 1.19
- 13 Endpoints is not considers for conformance anymore
- Conformance coverage changed from 54.12% in 1.19 to 63.40% in 1.20
- Percentage change in conformance coverage is not a stable measure of success. There is a constant change in the number of GA endpoints.
 (Promotion from Beta to GA or Depreciation)


*** **KR2 clean-up technical debt**
- Goal: [[https://apisnoop.cncf.io/conformance-progress#coverage-by-release][Clear]] debt back to 1.15
- Stretch Goal: Clear debt to 1.14
- In 1.20 Technical debt have been cleared back to 1.11
** **Release Blocking k/k Job**
*** **Progress**
- The job within [[https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/19173][k/test-infra#19173]] is runnig on [[https://prow.k8s.io/?job=apisnoop-conformance-gate][prow.k8s.io]]
- prow.k8s.io working and catching untested new endpoints
  - APISnoop is gaining community [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/96524][traction]]
  - [[https://prow.k8s.io/?job=apisnoop-conformance-gate][apisnoop-conformance-gate]]
- further automation is in progress
** **Other Important News**
*** **Timeline**
- 1.20 was a short cycle
  - Test freeze 23 November 2020
  - Code freeze 12 November 2020
  - Release date 8 December 2020
*** **Conformance Gate**
- cncf/k8s-conformance gate is running
** **Looking forward to 1.21**
We will continue to focus on the Increase of Stable Test Coverage
*** **KR1 increase new conformant stable endpoints**
Inspite of increasing technical challenges, for 1.21 we would keep the target of 30 endpoints
With our stretch goal set at 40 Endpoints
*** **KR2 clean-up technical debt**
Our target would be clearing the technical debt of 1.11 & 1.10

** **Questions / Feedback**
In what other ways can we support the CNCF?
