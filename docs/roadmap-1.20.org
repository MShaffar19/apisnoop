    - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/92950][PodPorxy redirect test +7 Endpoint coverage]]
    - [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/92950][NodeProxy Redirect Test - +7 endpoint coverage]]
      Both test currently on lower priority, with a third test for ServiceProxy that can follow
    - PodProxyWithPath Mock test
    - 3 PR's for 17 Endpoints with intermittend flakes being reviewed
*** Discovering "missing" Conformance tests

- Stretch Goal: 6 of 18 Endpoints of 1.14
- Only 5 endpoints remain for 1.14
- [[ https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/94954][Engaged]] with #SIG-Scheduling to pick up their technical
- They are making progress:[[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/94954][Untested Priority Class Life Cycle Test #94954]]
- This would clean techical debt back to 1.11
