#+AUTHOR: ii.coop

* v1.21
  Our goal is to not make radical changes to process or approach, but iterate on our working methods to increase velocity and output in a stable, consistent way.

6 months of debt to erase!
  1.11 +2: {read,patch}ApiregistrationStatus

  - The endpoint was mark as "Not eligible for conformance yet"
*** Taking ownership to the community
  - Up to 1.20 Inligible endpoint was managed by ii
  - This was done via SQL quieries in APISnoop
  - We proposed in SIG Architecture to move it
    to the community
