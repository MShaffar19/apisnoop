* Useful Insights

** Untested Stable Endpoints

If we filter out any endpoints not hit by the e2e.test user-agent, we noted some completely untested stable endpoints in use by probably everybody:

The regex ~[^e2e.test]~ allows us to filter endpoints to User-Agents/applications hitting the APIServer that are not directly tested.

- 95 untested of [[https://apisnoop.cncf.io/?useragents=%5B^e2e.test%5D&zoomed=level-stable][237 stable endpoints]]
- 41 untested of [[https://apisnoop.cncf.io/?useragents=%5B^e2e.test%5D&zoomed=category-stable-core][122 stable/core endpoints]]

[[./docs/images/user-agent-e2e-filter.png]]

These are endpoints that are not hit be e2e.test at all, but hit by other components of kubernetes.

** Stable/Storage Coverage

If we zoom into stable storage endpoints, we find only one conformance test, and 14 completely untested endpoints.

** csi-attacher Coverage

If we filter user-agent for csi-attacher we find it hits 3 untested beta endpoints, and the untested stable/core/replaceCoreV1PersistentVolume:

[[https://apisnoop.cncf.io/?useragents=csi-attacher]]

It might be interesting to explore why we are hitting it during release-blocking. While itâ€™s not being hit by the e2e.test binary itself, it may be a by-product of the testing.

** [sig-windows] Coverage

Filtering by tests tags allows us to easily get a summary of all endpoints and tests with matching tags:

[sig-windows] has 4 tests which hit 75 endpoints, all of which are also hit by other [Conformance] tests:

It might be interesting to see this output from a job running more of the windows tests again a windows cluster.

By test_tags: [[https://apisnoop.cncf.io/?test_tags=\%5Bsig-windows\%5D]]
By test name: [[https://apisnoop.cncf.io/?tests=\%5Bsig-windows\%5D]]

Lastly we can filter on tests directly allowing us search for a group of tests, or focus on a single one:

[k8s.io] [sig-node] SSH should SSH to all nodes and run commands

[[https://apisnoop.cncf.io/?tests=\%5Bk8s.io\%5D%20\%5Bsig-node\%5D]]

SSH should SSH to all nodes and run commands

We also allow zooming into a particular endpoint to see what Test and test tags hit it:

[[./docs/images/zoom-getStorageResources-tests.png]]

If you click on a test, you can see a summary of its interation with the k8s API:
