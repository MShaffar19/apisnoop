fixme: create shows +5^, mock+promotion shows +4
same issue as configmap lificle:
this doesn't verify that the endpoints is deleted.
it just watches for an endpoints deletion event.
would this test fail if it didn't see a deletion event?
**** needs review +6
***** comments +2 promote: configmap lifecycle test #88034 (comments addressed)
conceptually this pr adds watches
there's no gaurantee that we will see the watch.
let's ensure what happens in the negative case.
when your waiting for the config map to be deleted, how do you know it's not deleted.
for each watch:
what happens if the watch times out...
when you setup a watch to timeout after 60 seconds....
pretend it's running on a super slow processor
what if it times out for every single test.... would i want the watch to be considered a failure....
probably... if it doesn't execute to completion.
it's not clear that that happens

  addressed the [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89453#discussion_r400346746][comment]]:
  "not sure this will work, you will be racing with the kubelet, i think. that is, kubelet may mark it ready again."
**** sorted backlog +5
***** backlog +2 servicestatus lifecycle
- org-file: https://github.com/cncf/apisnoop/pull/298
- mock-test: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/89135
 currently, this test is having issues writing to the servicestatus endpoints (via patch and update).
 the data is patched without errors, but the data when fetched is no different to before the patching.
***** backlog +3 serviceaccount lifecycle
- mock-test: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/89071
 @johnbelamaric you don't need to check the status of the secret as part of the test. in other places we check that the resource in question happens, we don't have to follow.
