* Introduction
  This project is a proof of concept for making the web interface of modular and dynamic, by turning it into a React app.  Our current site can be found here:[[https://apisnoop.ii.coop][apisnoop.ii.coop]].  For the first go of this, we want our app to look nearly identical, with the same functionality:
- visual display
- Dropdown to choose between csv's
- Ability to download the audit-log or csv.
** Why Do this?
   The current site is entirely hard-coded html. Whenever we want to make a change to the site (like adding a new dataset), it requires going into the html file, finding the right section, and adding a new static link.  Not only is this time-consuming, it's error-prone. It's also really hard to maintain.

The site also bears the mark of different hands with different ideas moving quickly to get something 'working' but not pretty.  So the site is using multiple CSS frameworks plus custom CSS and multiple javascript helper utilities.  This also makes the site hard to reason about or design, as you don't know what things you can change and what things are required for the framework.

The current site was the most basic proof of concept. We want to build a whole bunch of things on top of this, including github authorization and site-visitor customizatioin, and the ability to really customize the view you are seeing.  So I want to start again with a foundation to the site that is easier to reason about, easier to maintain, and easier to extend.

* Architecture
The site will be made to have a distinct front-end and backend, with the front-end able to be ported over to any other backend.
The front-end will consist of multiple components that wait to be told what data to display, instead of being written as part of the component.  In this way, if we want to make changes to our 'SIG Tag Bubble', we can just find the component named that and make changes there, instead of trying to find/replace the code within the file.
** FRONTEND
The frontend will be made with React, Redux, maybe Saga, and Tachyons, and Axios
*** Why React?
    [[https://reactjs.org/][React]] is the most well-known and supported front-end framework among my dev friends in Wellington, and is widely used and respected globally.  It was created originally by Facebook and then made open-source.  So it has a tremendous amount of support around it and good video tutorials for learning it.  I find it to be a bulky and kinda clumsy framework (which is why the first version of this used my personal fave Choo instead), but felt it was good to pick one that more people knew (and could help with).

*** Why Redux?
   [[https://redux.js.org/][Redux]]  provides one global 'state' for the app, and makes React actually usable.  It will help us push the data appropriately to the right parts and keep things clean and efficient.

*** AXIOS
   [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios][Axios]] is a simple tool for handling http requests across different servers.  We'll need this for the client to be portable, and able to call to multiple API's (our backend plus github for example).
*** Why Saga?
   [[https://redux-saga.js.org/][Saga]] helps us with api calls and redux.  Redux likes pure clean objects sent to the store right away.  API calls don't work like that, and so Saga does the call and then sends the results to Redux.  It's working as a side effect.

*** Why Tachyons?
    Tachyons is a css framework for writing functional CSS.  It's a much different approach to CSS, but it's one that matches a unix philosophy and is super easy to spin things up and maintain them.  AS we make changes, we don't have to worry that some class hidden deep in some css file causes our whole site to look weird.  Instead, every class has a single purpose, and you add multiple classes to a site to add-upon and combine each of these classes functions (like piping commands together on the command line).  This makes all our components //reusable// too, as we only need to copy over the code and not any stylesheet attached to the code.
** BACKEND
   For the backend we will be using Feathers //for right now//.  We may find that we want something completely different, or that we want our webui to be able to live in multiple places.  Our goal is for the two to be entirely separate, so either can change if needed.
*** Feathers
    [[https://feathersjs.com/][Feathers]] is a well-designed and well-documented api layer written in Node.  It has good support among my Wellington dev friends, and so I have better help if I encounter any sorta problem.  It also is just really pleasant to use so far, with a good model for how to create different services.  It also has an existing React connector.

** Our Current Flow
   I would like to document the current setup, to make sure I can reason about it.

  We will have a site listed anywhere, for now it's localhost so we'll call it LH.

  We want to know which commits(?) of kubernetes should have conformance tests made for them, this is handled in a config.yaml file in kubernetes test-infra folder on github.

 The log of their tests is found in the artifacts of the latest build of the test found in gcsweb.k8s.io.  We need to know the exact url to ping for gcs to return any proper info for us.


And so we grab the config info from github and parse its contents looking for commits that we are intersted in (like all gce-conformance commits).  Then, we take a look at the test_group_name for each commit and use that info to parse the config file again.  Each test group name has a GCS_Prefix, which gives us the url path we can ping with gcsweb.io

So let's say there's a commit called 'commmit1.2'.  This commit has a test_group_name of 'foo_test'.  That test_group has a prefix of '/jenkins/tests/log/foo_test'.  This means we can go to gcsweb.io/gcs/jenkins/tests/log/foo_test and get more information about this particular test group.

That information is a bit of an overload though.  It has folders for all the builds along with a text file that contains a number that is the latest build.  so in foo_test we'd see a bunch of folders named "100, 101, 102, 103" plus "latest-build.txt".  Clicking on latest-build.txt gives us something like: '103', which we know means we should look in folder 103 for all the relevant stuff.

The txt file, though just a number, isn't stored on gcsweb.io.  It's actually stored at 'storage.googleapis.com'.  So trying to grab gcsweb.io/$GCS_PREFIX/latest-build.txt will give us a redirect.  If we grab that number, following the path of that latest build folder leads us to a url of something like:
http://gcsweb.k8s.io/gcs/kubernetes-jenkins/logs/foo_test-1-12/187/artifacts/bootstrap-e2e-master/

there's also different bootstrap folders beyond master for many of these.

Then, inside //this// folder would be some audit-logs.  These logs are what we are REALLLY looking for, as they have the data we want to visualize.


This means, though, that when we start up the app we need to ping github and with the converted response from that ping gcsweb.k8s.io and with the response from that site ping gcsweb again but at a specific url, looking for a specific type of file and with the response of that get a big buffer of text that we try to convert into json so that we can feed it into our components.


I feel like this is a tremendous amount to put onto a webpage upon first loading, and that there's a number of errors that could come up.  How much of this can be done by our server so it's at the ready when the page loads up.

For example: I can't imagine the config.yaml file updates /aaaalll/ that much.  If we have something that is current to the latest day, or even yesterday, would that be okay?  And if that's okay, is there a way we could pull the yaml file and add it to our database so we'd have something like:
- ourserver.com/dashboards
- ourserver.com/test_groups
- ourserver.com/commits
and each of these we could ping instead to get the info we want?  Then we aren't doing real-time conversion of a blob into a string into yaml into json---it's just ready for us.

In the same way, is there anyway we can parse our own api and grab the audit logs we need, and have them converted into json for us to parse.  So the web page loads, pings our server, finds the audit logs, and renders them.....That might be redundancy though, since they //are// already available on a server at gcsweb.  It just takes us some loops to figure out where.

The question I have, ultimately, is how much should be handled by the client and how much should be pre-requested/filtered/converted by the server before the client latches on---and whether there's a simpler way to do what we're trying to do.

* Backend
** Setting up our API Initially
**** Generating the backend app.
     #+NAME: Generate Feathers App
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
       mkdir backend && cd backend
       feathers generate app
     #+END_SRC
**** Generating the Services
     We'll need a config service, which will be custom.  It makes a request to our config.yaml file and then distributes its contents to our various other services.
 From there, we need a service named for each of the major groups:
 - dashboards
 - test_groups
 - dashboard_names
** Services
*** Config
    This is the service used to ping github for our config file, and then populate the various dashboards from there.
**** Setting up config service.
     :PROPERTIES:
     :header-args: :noweb yes :tangle ./backend/src/services/config/config.class.js
     :END:
***** Basic Layout
 So we create a new class for the service and construct it with the options we give it.  In this case, the options relate to the request to our github api that we want to send.  Then, we have a number of commented out methods followed by our setup method.  The setup method requests the configyaml from github, loads it into json, and then distributes each group using our distribute function (described in more detail below).
 #+NAME: config.class.js
 #+BEGIN_SRC js
   /* eslint-disable no-unused-vars */
   const request = require('request-promise')
   const yaml = require('js-yaml')

   var options = {
     url: 'https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/test-infra/git/blobs/66c3f57e899a92afc9f6fca20387220a65312915',
     headers: {
       'User-Agent': 'request'
     }
   }

   class service {
     constructor (options) {
       this.options = options || {};
     }
     <<commented out methods>>

     async setup (app, params) {
       request(options).then(blob => {
         blob = JSON.parse(blob)
         var content = Buffer.from(blob.content, 'base64').toString()
         var configGroups =  yaml.safeLoad(content)
         distribute(app, configGroups)
       })
     }
   }

   <<Distribute Config Groups To Individual Services>>
   <<Populate Entries For Each Service>>

   module.exports = function (options) {
     return new service(options);
   };

   module.exports.service = service;
 #+END_SRC

 #+RESULTS: config.class.js
***** Distribute Config Groups To Invidiual Services

 Our config file is given a number of groups, and half of them we don't care about.  We want to just create api services for these.
 Each of these will need to have a service named like so: 'api/v1/service_name', this is done using the feathers cli (feathers generate service)
 #+NAME: Distribute Config Groups To Individual Services
 #+BEGIN_SRC js :tangle no
   function distribute (app, configFile) {
     var relevantSections = ['dashboards', 'test_groups', 'dashboard_groups']
     for (var section of relevantSections) {
       var configSection = configFile[section]
       var service = app.service(`/api/v1/${section}`)
       populate(service, configSection)
     }
   }

 #+END_SRC

***** Populate Entries For Each Service
      Here we check the current db for the entry, using its name.  If it doesn't exist, we make it.  If it does, we should update it.
      first we have to check whether there's anything that exists.  So we do a service.find() and if there are no results, we create the entry.  If there are results, we check if they match our query.

     This is kind of a gross function (or a straight up gross function) I don't l ike nested if/else statements.  I feel there is a better way to handle this.
     I am also having a problem where it is only creating a single entry every single time for each one.  like...it knows

    Once I do have this, then i'll be able to restart the server, it'll make a db if needed, if not it will check the db for the existing entry, and then it will add or updae the entry....

    For some reason right now, it is only adding the last one--but enough times that I know it's going through each one.  Do I need to await some respone on a thing?
      #+NAME: Populate Entries For Each Service
      #+BEGIN_SRC js :tangle no
        async function populate (service, configSection) {
          for (var entry of configSection) {
             var existingEntry = await service.find({query:{name: entry.name}})
             if (existingEntry.length === 0) {
               service.create(entry)
             } else {
               service.update(existingEntry[0]._id, entry)
             }
           }
         }

      #+END_SRC
***** Commented Out Methods
 #+NAME: commented out methods
 #+BEGIN_SRC js :tangle no
     // async find (params) {
     //   return [];
     // }

     // async get (id, params) {

     //   };
     // }

     // async create (data, params) {
     //   if (array.isarray(data)) {
     //     return promise.all(data.map(current => this.create(current, params)));
     //   }

     //   return data;
     // }

     // async update (id, data, params) {
     //   return data;
     // }

     // async patch (id, data, params) {
     //   return data;
     // }

     // async remove (id, params) {
     //   return { id };
     // }

 #+END_SRC
     Since it's a custom one, it has no Model or built-in functionality.  What we'll want to do is create a 'setup' function fro it that pings github and returns the config.yaml.  Then, it'll distribute its contents to our different api's.

 We can alter the class of our config service, defining what every single type of method does.  The big one for us is the 'setup' method.  And, in fact, since this is just a sorta dashboard arranger, we could get rid of alot of the other methods.

      Interesting thing here with async functions.  I have to put the quick ones in (like addBranch) before I do the addGcsPrefix.  If I try to add branch //after// this, then dashboardTab becomes undefined, or rather it is a pending promise of sorts.

***** AddLatestBuild
      :PROPERTIES:
      :header-args: :noweb yes :tangle ./backend/src/hooks/add-latest-build.js
      :END:
      After the dashboard has been cleaned up, we check it's gcs_prefix and use that to find its latest build number.  This will require pinging that server and awaiting its response back.

      When you generate a hook using feathers cli, it automatically makes it an asynchronous hook.  This means that the functions happen in sequence in our dashboards.hooks.js.  So because addLatestBuild comes after

I started with a basic skeleton, and kinda like how i debugged this (or set it up as a thing to work on).  I wrote up the functions for the steps I'm trying to do, knowing each one would be asynchronous.  So here it's saying: if the thing coming in is for conformance, then add Builds for the Dashboards in its data before you return the context to the next thing (i.e. add it to the database).

For adding builds, we want to define the dashboards and then say they are going to be transformed by addingtheLatest build.  This is an asynchronous map function that returns just some hard-coded text back.

I console.log that text in my addLatestBuild section then, in my terminal running the program I have ~npm start | grep latestBuild~  .  So now I can just monitor that feed and make sure it shows what I think it should show.  If it does, I can then check out the dashboard on localhost to confirm that a latestBuild section has been added.

So now, I have a console.log setup to help me quickly, and I can confirm that the basic structure of all of this (the logic or whateveR) works.  Now I just need to have the grabLatestBuild portion ping a server.

      We'll be given a dashboard context that, if it has conformance-gce, should submit itself to the audits service with all the relevant deeetails.  We'll make this simpel right now, and handle the pinging of the server with the audits service.

      I also have confusion about async stuff still, of course.  I had issues when passing along the data originally that the dashboards would suddenly lose alot of details.  It works when I made success asynchronous, even though it's nonsense.  Like, everything I do is a 'sideffect' of the success function.  This doesn't smell right. and should be refactored.

      :END:
      We are using rp and cheerio to ping the gcsweb url that has all the various info from each k8s branch.  Our relevant info is within their bootstrap e2e master section, and we want to just look at the audit-log we find within there.

I checked the strucure of the file, and each link is held within a ~pure-u-2-5~ class.  Cheerio is like the node version of jquery, and so we can do nice jquery stuff like grab the hreft for the a link witin the pure class that contains the word 'audit'.

***** downloadAuditLog
      :PROPERTIES:
      :header-args: :noweb yes :tangle ./backend/src/hooks/download-audit-log.js
      :END:
****** General Notes
       This will happen after acquire, so we know that we have auditLogArray.  We'll take this array's url, and use request promise to grab all the stuff located there and write it to file.

       Since it's a big file, we'll wanna have a write stream, and perhaps upon success a ping saying '${branch} was successfully written.'

       A way to test this is to download the audit log to the same directory with a diff name, and then compare the line count for both files.

       We already have a data folder, that's holding our databases, and so I made a new folder called audit-logs within that file.  And I //think// we can just do a direct path to that from our hook.  So...i'ma try it now!
****** Code
    If you don't want to write all the logs to disk, then you can comment out writeToFile(branch, logPath)
    #+NAME: download-audit-log.js
    #+BEGIN_SRC js
      // Use this hook to manipulate incoming or outgoing data.
      // For more information on hooks see: http://docs.feathersjs.com/api/hooks.html

      // eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars
      const rp = require('request-promise')
      const fs = require('fs')
      const _ = require('lodash')

      module.exports = function (options = {}) {
        return async context => {
          var logPath = context.data.auditLogArray
          var branch = context.data.branch
          writeToFile(branch, logPath)
          return context;
        }
        <<write to file>>
        <<format by pattern>>
      }

    #+END_SRC

    If given the path to the file, I should be able to set up a write stream that writes all the contents.  I am a little unsure where everything would download (like the relative path), and so I'll do a simple stream that just takes the name given and writes it to a file named after that particular branch.

    The branch will have a name like 'GCE, v1.12 (release)'. I'd like this to be a filename, but it should be closer to gce_v1-12-release_audit.log
    I could do a bunch of string replacements, but I think lodash would be faster.

        var fileName = `${formattedPath}audit.log`
        var writeStream = fs.createWriteStream(`./data/audit-logs/${fileName}`)
        console.log(`Attempting to write file for: ${fileName}` + '\n' + 'from:' + '\n' + path + '\n' + '~*~*~*~*~*~*~~*~*')
        rp(path)
          .then(response => {
            writeStream.write(response)
            writeStream.end()
            writeStream.on('finish', () => console.log(`file written: ./data/audit-logs/${fileName}!`))
            writeStream.on('error', (err) => console.log(`error for ${fileName}: ${err}`))})

- Actions manage calls to the app's state, requesting new data.
- Components are modular parts of our UI, like dropdown boxes and navbars and such.
- Pages are collections of components that display based on the route of the site and the actions of the user.  They are similar to html pages.
- reducers listens to actions and the payload of data they contain and reducer that data into a single state tree for the app.  This is the data being called upon in the components.
- Sagas are not being used yet.

***** Introduction
    The app component is often seen as the 'layout template' for the frontend.  Anything we want to be displayed at all times should go here (e.g. a header and navbar).  The app component will also handle the navigation between the different components, based on routes given.

    This is a 'single-page-app' which means: to the server, we are only showing a single html page, the index.html.  Within this page we have javascript code running that renders different views dynamically, based on what the site visitor wants to see.  We can give these views the format of a URL, so it appears like we are going to different pages within apisnoop (and so we can share specific urls to others), but it's all really a continually transforming bit of Javascript.
***** Requirements
 I'll dive a bit into the import/requirements section as it sets up a style you see in a lot of React apps.

 We'll start by bringing in React and its Component class-we inherit all the features of this class when we render our own components, which gives them all the power we may not see at first.
   #+NAME: Import React
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
     import React, { Component } from 'react'
   #+END_SRC

 Next, we'll bring in react's smart navigation.  These are what make the app appear to be multiple pages.
 #+NAME: import routing and navigation
 #+BEGIN_SRC js
   import { Route } from 'react-router-dom'
 #+END_SRC

 Lastly, we bring in our different pages, which we can navigate between using a nice lil' tab and navlinks..
 #+NAME: import components
 #+BEGIN_SRC js
   import Header from './header'
   import Footer from './footer'
   import MainPage from '../pages/main-page.js'
 #+END_SRC

 #+RESULTS: import components

***** The overall Layout
      The general shape of this template is here:
    #+NAME: App Layout
    #+BEGIN_SRC js
      class App extends Component {
        render(){
          return (
            <div id='app'>
              <Header />
              <<Routes>>
              <Footer />
            </div>
          )
        }
      }

      export default App
    #+END_SRC

***** the Navlinks

    the navlinks will be visual components that act like standard links;  and so ~exact to~ acts like href.

    #+NAME: Nav Links
    #+BEGIN_SRC js :tangle no
      <div id='nav'>
        <NavLink exact to='/'>Audits</NavLink>
      </div>
    #+END_SRC
***** the Routes
    The routes listen to the paths chosen by nav and routes to the correct component.  So the components don't show unless the url path matches their route.
    #+NAME: Routes
    #+BEGIN_SRC js :tangle no
        <Route exact path='/' component={MainPage} />
    #+END_SRC
** Pages
   We are following a convention where, if a component acts as its own route and holds many different components within it, then it's called a page.  Think of navigating between different pages in a site, and each one is made up of several diff. section.  It is the same here, just that we are navigating between JS dispalying different Page components.

** Components
The various visual parts of the app.  For the most part, we want these to be as dumb as possible--they present the stuff they're given, and if they have to do any interactive stuff it remains contained to within itself.  Any other changes should be handled outside of the component through actionCreators our and reducer updating the global state of the app.  In other words, the components display the state as it is now, and they can trigger events which update the state, but they always simply display it as it is now.

    We also want to grab the gcs_prefix for each test_group_name of the commit.  Then we can pass both along to the component.  So we make sure we have a test_groups object, and when so we find each commit's particular test, and pass that along to our Commitcard component as a prop.

*** CommitCard

   Component for displaying the conformance-gce commits.  I think i want to do the test_group logic here.  This way, we could potentially only call something up when they've grabbed the particular commit and aren't trying to do all the requests at once.

And so the basic logic would be:
- Having this information, it can ping the server to grab its latest build number.

I am having difficulties with this due to CORS requests.  It's giving the error:
 'Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-jenkins/logs/ci-kubernetes-gce-conformance/latest-build.txt. (Reason: CORS header ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ missing).'

You can read more about this error on [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSMissingAllowOrigin?utm_source=devtools&utm_medium=firefox-cors-errors&utm_campaign=default][Mozilla's dev page]], but upon reading it, it seems like you'd want to add a header not on our requesting server but on the server that holds this info.  I can't imagine that I'm the only one who would have this problem, so I'm wondering if there's just a step I'm missing.  I know this worked in our api server, I could try to do something there again.

    We'll use the index page of the actions to set up our axios client.  axios handles our fetch requests, since we'll be fetching from another server and not from a data file within this app.  Axios is an http request client that uses promises (a new javascript convention for handling asynchronous calls).[[https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios][ Axios page on NPM]]

    We'll want to configure a client app for axios, that sets the host we are trying to connect to and the type of information we are expecting to get.  Since we are working with a feathers api, then we know we just need to grab JSON.
    #+BEGIN_SRC js
      import axios from 'axios'

      export const client = axios.create({
        baseURL: "http://apisnoop.cncf.io:3030",

        }
      })

   These work with redux to deliver our store an object that has a 'type' and a payload.  So the type tells our store reducers what to do with it, and the payload is the data that is being added to the global state.

    We are going to ping our feathers database to grab our contacts.  We've set up an axios client (in index.js) to handle these types of requests, so we'll bring it in, and use the client to grab data.

    #+END_SRC
**** Fetching Config
      The dispatch is being used so our redux stores can hear an action took place.  So we are sending out a broadcast(dispatch) that says 'FETCH CONFIG HAPPENED!' and we're bringing with it a payload.  Redux will hear this action, and assign the payload to the correct part of the app's state.

            })
          }
        }
      #+END_SRC

  When this is pinged it'll create a few new type of actions:
    + 'FETCH_CONFIG_PENDING'
    + 'FETCH_CONFIG_FULFILLED'
    + 'FETCH_CONFIG_REJECTED'

  This is done automatically, and so we don't need to create action creators for these various actions, we just need to tell our reducer to listen to the 'FETCH_CONFIG_FULFILLED' action and handle the payload appropriately.

** Working with d3
*** Introduction
   d3 is the data visualization library that was used to make our original sunburst.  The way it works is to mount itself to the dom, and then appends new elements to the dom based on the data it was given. If that data changes, it transforms the elements as needed.

   The way react works is it attaches itself to the dom, then creates a //shadow dom// that it is continually listening to, adding and removing elements in this dom as needed based on the data(the state) it was given.

   In other words, they work in largely the same way, and both wanna attach themselves to the dom and manipulate it.  This...isn't good.  We want to have /1/ thing making shadow doms and calls on the website, and so it is a bit tricky to get react and d3 working together.

The upside is that a number of people have tackled this challenge and created different react/d3 libraries for how the two can work together.  The downside is that I'm not sure yet which is the best to do.

Put simply, it is not easy to take our existing sunburst code and just paste it into our new app.  We are going to need to transform it in some way based on the guidance of the library we are using.

So the question is why we are putting ourselves into this trouble?
*** WHY WE ARE PUTTING OURSELVES INTO THIS TROUBLE
    My assumption with all of this is that when people hear 'apisnoop', they are thinking of the site in which you can see the data visualziations.  And so the webapp is important for the project and will be expanded.  React would be great for this in the long run.

Similarly, I am expecting that we are going to have more types of visualizations than just the sunburst--and that even the sunburst may change.  So we are going to want to have an understanding for a language in which we can make a //bunch// of visualizations. d3 is great for this.

If we do it right, we can have reusable components too that other teams could use for their own k8s projects, and that we could use ourselves.  For example--displaying two sunburst charts side by side would be much easier in react/d3 then what i ws trying to do before (appending both to the same id on a standard html document.)  This requires that I move through some d3 tutorials though.

At the end of this, though, we will have a backend server that is easy to setup and can ping different url's (github repos or testgrid artifacts) and grab their data.  Then, we can manipulate that data in whatever way we want but also pass it along to our frontend.  This front-end can then have different options and tags setto really dive in and explore.

If this is the purpose of apisnoop then let's do it.  If it's too much overkill though, then I can try a simpler solution.
*** Possible Process to get going
**** Setup a simple d3 visualization to understand the process
**** pipe data into this simple visualization through our redux state.
**** Pore over the original code again (the original blog post) to see how to best convert it
**** Change the sunburst's origin point from a CSV file to JSON
**** Change the sunbursts origin point from JSON to our redux store.
*** Second Process
**** Setup different pages for different d3-react libraries that already have ubilt components.
**** explore piping our data into the one we like.
**** Use testgrid conformance data and make simple visualizations to it.
     We are wanting to keep the data retrieval tied into the visualizing, so we dont' end up with a pretty graph that can't be used for what we have.  So we can grab the testgrid stuff now and see what we can do with it.


**** Use that going forward.

** Plan for Demo
- show our sunburst
- show a cloud of all tags.
- show a dropdown for user-agent
- if you chooose a tag, the user-agent dropdown reduces to just tests run by that tag.
- If you click on a sig tag, pull its general info from kubernetes/community/sigs.yaml
- when you hover over an endpoint, show a list of tests that also hit that endpoint. and nubmer of times that test hits that endpoint.

*** Navigating the config.yaml
    Starting at , here is how to relate the url view with the info on
    <<
**** [[file:config_yamls/config.yaml::dashboard_groups:][dashboard_groups:]]

    These top level dashboard groups are what populate the top level of [[https://k8s-testgrid.appspot.com][k8s-testgrid.appspot.com]]
***** [[file:config_yamls/config.yaml::dashboards:][dashboards:]]
****** [[file:config_yamls/config.yaml::test_groups:][test_groups:]]

**** Example [[file:config_yamls/config.yaml::-%20name:%20conformance-gce][For dashboard: conformance-gce]]
  if you were to look at
  dashboards.name['conformance-gce'].dashboard_tab, that ties to the summary tab you see at [[https://k8s-testgrid.appspot.com/conformance-gce][k8s-testgrid.appspot.com/conformance-gce]]
**** Test groups
     k8s
    Every testgroup name you find at:
   ~dashboards.name['conformance-gce'].dashboard_tab.name~
   has a section called 'test_group_name', and each test group name has its gcs_prefix (GCS standing for 'Google Cloud Services')

   For example, the test group name 'ci-kubernetes-gce-conformance-stable-1-12' has a gcs prefix of 'kubernetes-jenkins/logs/ci-kubernetes-gce-conformance-stable-1-12'.

   The json path for this testgroup gcs prefix would be:
   test_groups.name['ci-kubernetes-gce-conformance-stable-1-12'].gcs_prefix

   which takes you here: [[file:config_yamls/config.yaml::gcs_prefix:%20kubernetes-jenkins/logs/ci-kubernetes-gce-conformance-stable-1-12][gce-conformance-latest-1-12 gcs_prefix]]

   We could then...point that to a url where we'd grab the artifacts?
   like:
  http://gcsweb.k8s.io/gcs/$GCS_PREFIX

  we want to grab the latest text build, which is found at
  http://gcsweb.k8s.io/gcs/$GCS_PREFIX/latest-build.txt
   The goal now is to try to get as much done on the server, instead of trying to do it upon page requests in the client.  So what we would like is to have a server with an api that the client can ping that would give back the data needed based on the branch.  So I could do a request in the client for gce-conformance branch 1.12(dev), and that'd tie to some easy to reason about api path (/branches/1.12-dev), and this gives us the name of the latest build and the data taken from kube-servers api log.

So ultimately we want to be bringing down the gigs of data for the audit-logs and converted into something that can be rendered into a graph.

** Process
*** Tutorials
    I am going through some simple tutorials for connecting react to redux to feathers.  It's a slightly longer process, but it's going to set me up better for maintaining apisnoop.  My assumption is that this is not a one-and-done thing.  We will be continually adding features to apisnoop and these features will become increasingly more complex. In addition, we'll be needing to adapt apisnoop for different scenarios. So I want to understand the stack for our webapp entirely.

 I am coming in with good html and css knowledge for building personal projects.  What we are building is a production level app.  No matter how simple we make it, we will be pinging different sites, manipulating the data within those sites, and then displaying visualizations of our manipulations.  There isn't really a way to do this casually.  Especially if we want it to be stury and testable.  So I am biting off the sizable task of 'build a full-stack production-ready app by myself'.  I want to have all the tools I can to do this.

 So I am going to make a v. simple fullstack app and then add in our own customizations until we get to the point where I can hear a task and know exactly how to realize it in this code.
